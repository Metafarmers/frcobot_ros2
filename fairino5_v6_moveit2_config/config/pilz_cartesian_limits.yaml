# # Limits for the Pilz planner
# # Reduced max_trans_vel to prevent joint velocity limit violations
# # When converting cartesian velocity to joint velocity, the resulting joint velocities
# # can exceed limits, especially for joints far from the base (like j1)
# # For a 6-DOF robot with joint velocity limit of 3.14 rad/s, max_trans_vel should be
# # much lower to ensure joint velocities stay within limits during conversion
# #
# # Calculation: If j1 has max velocity 3.14 rad/s and robot arm length is ~0.8m,
# # then max_trans_vel should be approximately: 3.14 * 0.8 / safety_factor
# # With safety_factor of 10-20, max_trans_vel should be around 0.05-0.1 m/s
# # But since j1 is base joint, even smaller movements can cause high rotation,
# # so we use even more conservative value: 0.03 m/s
# cartesian_limits:
#   max_trans_vel: 0.05  # Balanced value: fast enough for linear motion, safe for joint limits
#   max_trans_acc: 0.15  # Increased to match higher velocity
#   max_trans_dec: -0.15  # Increased to match higher velocity
#   max_rot_vel: 0.3     # Increased for better linear motion speed

cartesian_limits:
  max_trans_vel: 0.5  # Further reduced from 1.0 to prevent joint velocity violations
  max_trans_acc: 0.5  # Reduced from 2.25
